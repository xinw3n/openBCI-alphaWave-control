# openBCI-alphaWave-control

The Processing code is modified from the helicopter control code written by Joel Murphy. It runs on Processing 2.2.1. 

To use the code, put the Arduino folder in your Document/Arduino, and the Processing folder in your Document/Processing (you will need to change the folder name to something that is not Arduino or Processing).
